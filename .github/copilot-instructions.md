- We are using bun for package management.
- We are in the root directory, so no need to change the directory.
- Before running `bun run dev` check if the server is already running on port 5173. If it is, do not start another instance.
- Use `openSimpleBrowser` tool to open the browser.
- Split code into smaller, focused files instead of putting everything in one large file.
- Do NOT create unnecessary markdown files to document changes unless specifically requested.
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible.
- Extract reusable logic into separate utility/system files.
