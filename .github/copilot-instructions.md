- This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime.
- Run `bun run check` to verify code quality and check for errors.
- Check if port 5173 is in use (use `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173`):
  - In use: Launch browser at http://localhost:5173/beehive/
  - Not in use: Run `bun run dev`, then launch browser at http://localhost:5173/beehive/
- Use `src/app.css` for global styles instead of `:global()` in Svelte components.
